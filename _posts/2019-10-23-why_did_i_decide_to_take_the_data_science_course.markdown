*“In the early twenty-first century the train of progress is again pulling out of the station – and this will probably be the last train ever to leave the station called Homo sapiens. Those who miss this train will never get a second chance. The main products of the twenty-first century will be bodies, brains and minds, and the gap between those who know how to engineer bodies and brains and those who do not will be far bigger than the gap between Sapiens and Neanderthals. In the twenty-first century, those who ride the train of progress will acquire divine abilities of creation and destruction, while those left behind will face extinction.”* ---  Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari

That train of progress in Harari's book is data and machine learning to me. I deeply believe that those who knows how to manipulate data and applies data (with the help of machine learning) will be the winner in this decade. 

In the first 9 years of my career, I worked as a fixed income trader. Towards the end of my career in 2013/14, regulation was tightening and traders are becoming middle men for market making rather than risk takers. I was certain that the machine can do my job if I am not allowed to take risk like I used to before the financial crisis. That's when I left. I knocked on doors of broker firm and suggesting that we should dis-intermediate the market makers in the banks who get paid large amout of money for doing something that machine could do better. They all listened, but no one dares to piss off their clients who are the big banks. Things have moved on 5 years later. Most of the market makers/traders are gone. In many of the liquid market, human is an assistant to the algorithm. Most of the ex-traders have no real optical skill to be re-employed by any other industry, despite they are some of the brightest people on earth. (Luckily, most of them had been paid very well to not have to worry about jobs.) This is the first expeirence in my life where data science and ML had changed a profession/industry.

For the past 5 years, I have been working in a VC/PE house, and work with technology startups. Every pitch deck has ML/Data in it. With my previous Engineering/Math backgorund and some reading online, I realised that most of them are BS. When they say 'data analytics', they meant 'excel spreasheet with possibliy maro VBA'. When they say they got 'Machine Learning', they meant 'linear regression'. When they say 'Deep Neural network', and you ask about the model, they admit that they don't know any detail. To demissify it, I decide to take the data science course to help me to understand what is possible, what part of the R&D is costing money, what is the bottle neck in implementation when a data software is sold, what is ready available off the shelf, and what is 'not quite there yet' technology. 

Lastly, I see studying data science is like learning how to use Excel back in the day. It will become the ubiquous tool for everyone in the business world, not just the juniors who crunches the numbers.
