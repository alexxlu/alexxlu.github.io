**Problem**: Prediction today's stock price based on past 7 days performance: High, low, open, close and volume.
In this project, I have picked Apple stock as an example, as it is a liquid stock with a good trading volume.

**Data**: Data was taken from Kaggle S&P500 dataset.

Raw Data at first glance:

Reformat the data: set date as index and shifting the columes preparing for modeling later on
