### Question 1: Do discounts have a statistically significant effect on the number of products customers order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?

**Step 0: inspect the sql contents and see if the tables names are as expected from the ERD diagram.**

It seems the ERD diagram is different from the actual sql extraction: 1)Employee vs Employees 2)EmployeeTerritory vs EmployeeTerritories ... it seems all the tables are singlar vs plural in the ERD table

![Northwind ERD](http://localhost:8890/view/dsc-2-final-project-online-ds-pt-100118/Northwind_ERD.png)

**Step 1: construct Hypothesis:**

Null Hypothesis (H0): Discount has no statistical significant relationship to number of products customer orders. mu_fp=mu_disc (mu_fp is the mean of full price quantity. mu_disc is the mean of discount quantity.) 

Alternative(H-alpha): Discount has a statistically significant impact to the number of products customer orders. Alpha is set to 0.05. mu_fp!=mu_disc

**Step 2: 
- extracts relevant data to form a data frame
- seperate the dataset into two sets (one with discount, and one without discount)
- visualize the two datasets**

OrderDetail table has all the revelant data we need (Discount and Quanity). 

#data set where there is no discount or full price (fp), or control
df_fp=pd.read_sql_query("select * from OrderDetail where Discount=0", engine)

Step 3: calculating p-value with T-Test function

#Calculating p-value
from scipy import stats
stats.t.sf(abs(t_stat), len(df_disc.Quantity)+len(df_fp.Quantity)-1)*2
