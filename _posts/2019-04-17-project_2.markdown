### Question 1: Do discounts have a statistically significant effect on the number of products customers order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?

Step 1: construct Hypothesis:

Null Hypothesis (H0): Discount has no statistical significant relationship to number of products customer orders. mu_fp=mu_disc (mu_fp is the mean of full price quantity. mu_disc is the mean of discount quantity.) 

Alternative(H-alpha): Discount has a statistically significant impact to the number of products customer orders. Alpha is set to 0.05. mu_fp!=mu_disc

Step 2: extracts relevant data to form a data frame:
